# Excel-Dashboard---Vrinda-Store-Analysis
## I created an interactive dashboard in MS Excel that depicts the annual sales report of Vrinda store, an e commerce store to solve a business problem.
## Performed data clening, data processing and data analysis on raw sales data.
## Created Pivot tables to create pivot charts, which were used to create the dashboard.
## Used slicers in the dashboard  so that the final user can gather more insights as per his/her requirement.
## Used filters to clean data.
